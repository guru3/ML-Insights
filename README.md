# ML-Insights

#### Trying out different ideas. It is easier to follow if going through it in numerical order!

#### Central observation for most of the analysis lying around neural networks being a black box with capabilities ( depending on size of network ) to learn a mapping from input data to output data. Convergence, however, may depend on other factors as the encoding on input/output, simplicity of relation between input and output, etc.
